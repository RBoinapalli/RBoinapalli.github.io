    <p>Aside from its physical benefits, the mental advantages that yoga has are huge. It makes one more mindful and relaxed, therefore less stressed and anxious. <br>

       hormone in the body, to bring out a calmer and more emotionally balanced person. All the same, regular practice also increases focus, concentration, and <br>
       clarity of the mind, which would make it an excellent tool for keeping up with life's demands. Moreover, yoga joins body and mind into one, creating serenity <br>
       and wellness from within a person.</p>
